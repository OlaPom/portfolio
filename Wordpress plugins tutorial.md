# WordPress plugins

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use plugins to enhance your WordPress website. It is intended for beginner WP users.

While every theme offers a certain amount of customization, it may not be enough to suit your needs. Plugins let you extend the functionality of your WordPress website without adding any code. With plugins, you can add features not available in your theme (e.g. a calendar) or get advanced customization options (e.g. custom fonts).

Plugins are commonly used to connect social media, show cookie notifications, or handle SEO. Most plugins are free, but some also have paid versions. For available plugins, check out the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to install and configure a plugin to create a cookie consent bar.
