# WordPress plugins

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use plugins to enhance your WordPress website. It is intended for beginner WP users.

While every theme offers a certain amount of customization, it may not be enough to suit your needs. Plugins let you extend the functionality of your WordPress website without adding any code. With plugins, you can add features not available in your theme (e.g. a calendar) or get advanced customization options (e.g. custom fonts).

Plugins are often used to integrate social media platforms, create cookie notifications, or manage SEO. Most plugins are free, but some also have paid versions. For available plugins, check out the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to install and configure a plugin to create a cookie consent bar.

## Install

To install a new plugin, you need to be an administrator.

1. In the **Dashboard**, go to **Plugins** > **Add new**.
2. In the search field, enter the name of the plugin or keyword (we will use the Responsive Cookie Consent plugin for this tutorial).
3. A list of all matching plugins appears, click **Install now** on the selected plugin.
   Before installation, make sure the plugin is compatible with your WP version.
4. After the installation is completed, click **Activate**.

## Configure

Once the plugin is active, you can start configuring the cookie consent bar.

1. In the dashboard, go to **Settings** > **RCC**.
2. Enter a cookie consent message and add a cookie policy URL. The plugin lets you customize the wording and style of the buttons.
3. Click **Save options**.

## Update

Remember to update the plugins regularly to ensure their proper functioning and the security of your website. You will see update notifications on the home screen.

1. To see the list of all installed plugins, go to **Dashboard** > **Plugins**.
