# Electronic paper

This article introduces the fundamentals of electronic paper technology and electrophoretic displays (EPD) developed by eInk Corporation in the late 1990s.

## Technology

EPDs work based on electrophoresis, which is the motion of dispersed particles in a fluid under the influence of an electric field.

Electronic ink is made of millions of microcapsules containing pigment particles floating in a clear fluid. The ink layer is placed between two electrode layers. The particles are charged: white - positively, black - negatively. When a voltage is applied to the electrode, the particles migrate according to their charges. The top electrode is transparent, so when black particles move to the top of the capsule, the surface of the display appears black in that spot.
EPDs use thin-film transistor technology to manage the application of appropriate voltage to specific parts of the display to form an image. Special software was designed to control voltage sequences using algorithms called waveforms. When the voltage is removed, the particles stay in their positions. Thanks to this characteristic, EPDs can hold a static image without electricity, which makes them highly energy efficient.

## Low power consumption

One of the distinguishing features of electronic paper displays is their ultra-low power consumption. EPDs only draw power when the content changes (and the particles must be rearranged). Unlike LCD screens, EPDs don't require constant refreshing and can work on a single battery charge for weeks.

## Readability

Electronic paper mimics the appearance of ink on ordinary paper (the technology even uses the same pigments as traditional printing). It also aims to give the reader the same experience in terms of readability.
EPDs are reflective displays: they don't emit any light but reflect ambient light just like paper. The text can be read in direct sunlight and at a wide viewing angle. EPDs also cause less eyestrain, as they don't need to be back-illuminated.
